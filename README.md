# C++ Examples

I wanted to learn C++ and learn best through projects, so I asked ChatGPT to generate me 10 project prompts that illustrate core concepts of C++. 

Here's the response:

Certainly! Learning C++ through a series of projects is a great way to master the language. Here's a curriculum of 10 C++ project prompts, each designed to illustrate fundamental concepts in the order they might be taught in a university class:

```
**Project 1: Hello World**
- Task: Create a simple C++ program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- Concepts: Setting up a C++ development environment, understanding the basic structure of a C++ program, and using the `cout` stream.

**Project 2: Variables and Data Types**
- Task: Build a program that prompts the user for their name and age, and then prints a message using these inputs.
- Concepts: Declaring variables, input and output, data types (int, string), and basic arithmetic operations.

**Project 3: Control Structures**
- Task: Create a program that checks if a given number is even or odd and provides the result.
- Concepts: `if` statements, conditional operators, and branching.

**Project 4: Loops**
- Task: Build a program that calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user.
- Concepts: `while` or `for` loops, loop control statements, and iterative algorithms.

**Project 5: Functions**
- Task: Develop a program that finds the maximum of two numbers using a user-defined function.
- Concepts: Function definition, function parameters, return values, and function calls.

**Project 6: Arrays**
- Task: Create a program that calculates the average of a set of numbers stored in an array.
- Concepts: Declaring and initializing arrays, array manipulation, and loops with arrays.

**Project 7: Classes and Objects**
- Task: Design a simple class to represent a car with attributes like make, model, and year. Create objects and display their properties.
- Concepts: Class definition, object instantiation, member variables, and member functions.

**Project 8: Pointers and Memory Management**
- Task: Build a program that swaps the values of two variables using pointers.
- Concepts: Pointers, memory allocation, and memory management.

**Project 9: File I/O**
- Task: Develop a program that reads data from a file and performs some processing or analysis on the data.
- Concepts: Reading from and writing to files, error handling, and file streams.

**Project 10: Inheritance and Polymorphism**
- Task: Create a program that models a simple inheritance hierarchy, such as different shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle) and calculate their areas polymorphically.
- Concepts: Inheritance, base and derived classes, virtual functions, and polymorphism.

These projects should cover a wide range of fundamental C++ concepts and help you become proficient in the language. As you progress through this curriculum, you'll gain a solid understanding of C++ and be well-prepared to tackle more advanced topics.

In this repo the hello world example is missing because that's so straight forward and the challenge is compiling the code not necessarily writing it, and also the example for functions is missing because I accidentally skipped ahead in the factorial example because I wanted to try out the loop approach and the recursive approach.
